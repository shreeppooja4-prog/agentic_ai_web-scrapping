Agentic AI Web Scraper

An **Agentic AI Web Scraper** that extracts website content and allows users to ask intelligent questions using an AI language model.  
The project combines **web scraping**, **agent-based reasoning**, and a **modern UI** built with web technologies.

 Project Overview:

This application scrapes textual content from a given website and stores it as internal knowledge.  
An AI agent then uses this stored data to answer user questions in natural language.

The system demonstrates how **Agentic AI** can be used to build intelligent tools that observe, store, reason, and respond.

 AI & Agent Description:

The project uses a custom rule-based agentic AI model.  
The agent performs the following steps:

1. Scrapes website data (Perception)
2. Stores relevant content as memory
3. Selects important context
4. Uses a Large Language Model to generate answers

The Large Language Model used is **GPT-4o-mini**, which generates natural language responses based on the scraped context.
